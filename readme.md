\f0\fs24 \cf0 Welcome to uncloud!\
\
Uncloud! is a simple weather app that will provide the temperature and weather condition for a given location.\
\
Uncloud! is web based, and should launch fine by clicking on the index.html file.\
\
Uncloud! uses some more advanced features of CSS3. It is therefore recommended that your web browser is fully up to date before attempting to launch the index.html file.\
\
Thanks for checking out Uncloud! and I hope you enjoy!\
